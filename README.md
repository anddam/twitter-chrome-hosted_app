* Twitter hosted app for Chrome

The simplest app I could think of, I needed a big birdie bookmark in my Chrome app page.

* How to use

Download or clone the repo, then follow [instructions to load an unpacked extension](http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide.html#installing):
1. in Chrome, bring up the extensions management page by choosing Tools > Extensions
1. if Developer mode checkbox is not enabled, enable it
1. click the ''Load unpacked extension'' button
1. a file dialog appears
1. in the file dialog, navigate to the folder you just downloaded and click ''OK''
1. you've now installed the app
1. create a new tab
1. the icon for the Twitter hosted app appears in Chrome's launcher
